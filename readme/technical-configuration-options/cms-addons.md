# CMS addons

Front-ends for popular CMS are available in the github project;

* [Wordpress](https://github.com/UltraSimplified/OpenCATS/tree/master/wordpress-plugin/wp-opencats) (for job listing display only) - an alternative is to use WP Job Manager and provide it with jobs via an XML feed.
* [Drupal](https://github.com/Inuits/drupal-cats-plugin) (job listings, and applications  direct into opencats)
* [Joomla _DEPRECATED_](https://github.com/opencats/joomla-connector) __ but retained for example of complete Joomla integration
